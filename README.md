# Description
The concept of home security provides homeowners a sense of ease and assurance that their property will be well protected against criminal activity. The group aims to design a project which not only administers a fully equipped monitor and motion detection alarm system, but also a step-by-step process which warrants all posted requirements of the ECE 372 Final Project.
